# PHP Date/Time Bug: Timezone Misconfiguration
This repository demonstrates a common but easily overlooked bug in PHP applications related to date and time handling. The core issue stems from an incorrectly configured server timezone, causing date and time outputs to be inaccurate.

## Bug Description
The `DateTime` class in PHP, while powerful, relies on the server's timezone setting. If this setting is incorrect or missing, the output of date and time functions will be offset, potentially leading to significant issues in applications where accurate timekeeping is critical. 

## Solution
The provided solution showcases how to explicitly set the timezone using `date_default_timezone_set()` before creating `DateTime` objects. This ensures consistent and accurate date and time information, regardless of the server's default timezone configuration.
